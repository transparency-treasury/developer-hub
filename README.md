====================

*The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is committed to creating openness and transparency in the federal government. This openness fosters accountability, allows for citizen participation, increases trust and confidence in the federal government, and ensures effective and efficient operations. 
To meet these objectives the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) has developed a portal to make the financial data it collects accessible to the public and its partners through transparency.treasury.gov. 
The APIs made available on transparency.treasury.gov, originate from financial data provided by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, and can facilitate everything from advanced analytics to simple reports hosted in separate programs or on separate websites.
