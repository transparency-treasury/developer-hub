#### Overview

The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is committed to creating openness and transparency in the federal government. This openness fosters accountability, allows for citizen participation, increases trust and confidence in the federal government, and ensures effective and efficient operations.

To meet these objectives, the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) has developed a portal to make the financial data it collects accessible to the public through transparency.treasury.gov.



###  Overview

The Application Program Interface (API)s made available on transparency.treasury.gov, originate from financial data provided by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, and can facilitate everything from advanced analytics to simple reports hosted in separate programs or on separate websites.


###  Get started

We welcome you to explore the available API’s on transparency.treasury.gov. These APIs allow you to analyze financial data trends and patterns and gain insights about federal government debt management, collections, accounting and payment data.

Over time we will expand the API’s available through transparency.treasury.gov to provide improved access to integrated financial management information. Your participation is critical to the success of this effort, and we value your feedback.  We welcome you to share your applications and provide input at any time.

If you have any questions or concerns, or encounter technical issues, please [contact](https://transparency.treasury.gov/fir/contact) a member of the support team.  

Your use and access to the API's are governed by the applicable [Terms of Service](https://transparency.treasury.gov/fir/article/terms-of-service) Agreement.
