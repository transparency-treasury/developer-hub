#### Overview

The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is committed to promoting openness and transparency in the federal government. This openness fosters accountability, allows for citizen participation, increases trust and confidence in the federal government, and ensures effective and efficient operations.

To meet these objectives, the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) has developed a portal to make certain financial data it collects accessible to the public through transparency.treasury.gov.

The Application Program Interface (API)s made available on transparency.treasury.gov, originate from financial data provided by the Fiscal Service, and can make everything easier, from advanced analytics to simple reports hosted in separate programs or on separate websites.


###  Get started

We welcome you to explore the available APIs on transparency.treasury.gov. These APIs allow you to analyze financial data trends and patterns and gain insights about federal government debt management, collections, accounting and payment data.

Over time we will expand the APIs available through transparency.treasury.gov to provide better access to integrated financial management information. Your participation is critical to the success of this effort, and we value your feedback.  We welcome you to share your applications and provide input at any time.

If you have any questions or concerns, or encounter technical issues, please [contact](https://transparency.treasury.gov/contact) a member of the support team.  

Your use and access to the APIs are governed by the applicable [Terms of Service](https://transparency.treasury.gov/article/terms-of-service) Agreement.
